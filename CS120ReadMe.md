## Information
1. Name: Sindangdong Tteokbokki (Taeju Kwon, Jihyeon Song, Geonhwi Sim)
2. Assignment Name / Number: Prototype 2
3. Course Name: CS120
4. Term: Fall 2020


## Incomplete Thing  
There are some bugs.
1. You can choose the same ingredients several times.
2. Even with the same ingredients, the amount of money is calculated at 500 won each.


## What We Proud of
1. Taeju Kwon:
Unlike the previous team, communication is so well. And I personally made my favorite game. Our game is so cute! I could use the things that I learned in class well. It was hard to make it a game but also it was fun because with close and friendly people.

2. Jihyeon Song:
It was a very good experience to make the game similar to the game I played when I was a kid. And everyone was passionate and affectionate about the game. So, I think we were able to get a lot of good ideas and make a cute and impressive game. It was difficult to make codes, but it was a chance to take a step further and grow. I want to study more during vacation and make good games in the future.

3. Geonhwi Sim:
Everyone worked very well. We didn’t give up and ran to the goal. We talked until 4 AM. When teammates had problems, every teammate  helped to solve the problems. And from the learning of the previous project I used communication skills and time managing skills. And again I noticed that making the game isn’t easy. We need to have creative ideas and should implement them. It is really hard and I’m going to think about great ideas for this winter vacation.


## Code RequireMent
- Made good use of File IO with the ifstream and ofstream types:
main.cpp line 35 ~ 46 / line 52 ~ 60
- Made good use of std::map and/or std::unordered_map:
screen.cpp line 105 ~ 112
- Uses the most appropriate loop statements for the kind loop that is done:
mainIn.cpp line 19 ~ 21
- Make good use of class/struct:
SubI.h line 8 ~ 62
- Make good use of References:
main.cpp line 21
- If using shared global variables then they are defined in a header file with the inline keyword:
setting.h line 39
- Constants are defined as constexpr whenever possible:
setting.h line 36
- Make good use of using statements:
screen.cpp line 366
- Collection of variables are put into a struct or class object:
screen.h line 27 ~ 35
- Created and used your own namespace:
enum.h line 23 ~ 33
- Made one more constexpr functions:
screen.cpp line 14 ~ 16
- If functions are defined in header files then they are marked as inline or constexpr:
setting.h line 39
